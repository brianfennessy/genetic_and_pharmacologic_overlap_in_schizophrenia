# Mechanistic overlap between genetic risk and pharmacologic modulation of psychosis

Hello! Thank you for reading. We hope you enjoyed our paper, "Mechanistic overlap between genetic risk and pharmacologic modulation of psychosis." If you are looking to reproduce our results, there are several datasets that you need to download first. The data sets that we start with are listed below. A link is provided where you can download each data set. We have also indicated whether the data is open access, or if you must register with the respective organization to access the data.

In terms of the code for this project, our approach can be broken down into eleven major sections including an initial section for in-house functions. These sections are outlined and briefly described below. The section names numbers correspond to folders in the GitHub directory. In each section folder we have provided the code we used to produce the results in our paper. Happy reproducing!

Section One: In-house functions created by Alexander Charney.

Section Two: Standardizing drug, target, and mechanism data.

Section Three: Identifying ATC antipsychotic drugs.

Section Four: Identifying VigiBase propsychotic drugs.

Section Five: Identifying propsychotic and antipsychotic drug targets.

Section Six: Identifying significant propsychotic and antipsychotic drug targets (those hit more frequently than by chance) and evaluating overlap between propsychotic and antipsychotic significant targets (both with and without central nervous system drugs).

Section Seven: Identifying significant propsychotic and antipsychotic drug-target mechanisms (those occurring more frequently than by chance).

Section Eight: Evaluating overlap between propsychotic or antipsychotic drug targets with rare or common variants implicated in schizophrenia risk.

Section Nine: Creation of final results table.
